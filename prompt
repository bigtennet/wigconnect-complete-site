I have a wig sales service where I help people bring in wigs from vietnam, India and eastern europe, especially from Vietnam. It is particularly unique because I offer the service  for a very cheap price for people in Nigeria.

Now, I'm meeting you a very professional junior dev to a full stack web developer to build a clean landing page for me, it should have a clear CTA for them to connect securely to the service with their whatsapp line, after they click the button, you will prompt them with a very beautiful modal to input their whatsapp number, then, after that, it should generate a link with a predefined text that once they click, it will take them to whatsapp and then the message will continue from there

Make the modal have a loading animation after they input their number to continue and then supply tem the predefined text link

Make it very responsive, I don't like the generic design, make it look really modern, aesthetic, you know girls like something aestheic, you can use shadcn and tailwindcss cdn too

instead of using fixed values for all, now, let it pick them from a json file which will act as settings.json for the business name, owner number, color theme, dark/light mode: true/false, what else?

fix the website and make the modal stop popping up first on load, it should only be tied to the button presses, work on ittt!!
